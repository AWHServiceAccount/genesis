# ToDo / Could be cool

* Dependencies for whatever is 'generated'. (Base classes for Entities, Controllers, ViewModels, Views, etc.)
* Tests? Tests.
* A real scripting language? Maybe Terrajobst's compiler ;)
* Communication between IGenesisExecutors that have been scanned? Maybe expose 'what I can do' and 'what I can handle' properties?
* Console session logging, or a mechanism to provide to populators and generators enabling them to log to the console or file etc. 
* Reloading of commands?
* Run a proper templating engine?
